I am a postdoc in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech, hosted by Cheng Mao. I received my PhD in statistics in 2024 from Yale University, advised by Sekhar Tatikonda. I am broadly interested in **high-dimensional probability and statistics**, as well as statistical physics, in particular **spin glasses and disordered systems**. To elaborate, I am interested in the following topics:

* Understanding dependence structures, phase transitions, and the efficacy of message-passing algorithms in diluted and mean-field models. I am especially interested in elucidating the underlying mechanisms behind variational principles for free energies.

* Statistical physics techniques in planted models, leading to insights about the fundamental limits of inference and algorithm design.

* Chaining frameworks for bounding suprema of stochastic processes---especially algorithms and explicit constructions of majorizing measures or weighted partitions and their applications in statistics or computer science problems.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about any of these subjects. Otherwise I'm sure we can find something interesting to discuss!
